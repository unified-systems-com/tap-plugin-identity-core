    Deliberately role-free. Whether an organization is a customer, a vendor, an assessor or the
    operator is a relationship some other plugin asserts about it, never its type: the same
    company is a customer in one instance and a vendor in another, and a type that bakes one
    view in cannot be shared. An instance plugin that needs "customer" draws that edge itself.

    ``domain`` is the organization's primary DNS domain when one is known; blank means not
    observed, not "has none". There is no free-form ``configuration`` blob: nothing collects an
    organization's source record, so the field would only be a place for unchosen data to collect. Identity rests on ``name`` in v0 because a designed organization
    often has no domain yet; revisit when an observer can supply a stronger key.
