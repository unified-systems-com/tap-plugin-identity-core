    An Okta user, a Duo user, a Teleport user and a GitLab user are four vendor records; when
    they are the same person, each draws ``HELD_BY_HUMAN__identity_core`` to one ``human``. That
    join is what an access review asks ("everything this person can reach"), and no vendor
    plugin can own it without depending on the others.

    Identity is ``handle``: an identifier the operator assigns and keeps stable, such as an HR
    employee number or the organization's canonical username. Not ``name``, which changes, and
    not an email address, which is an account attribute that is reassigned and aliased. The
    type carries no free-form ``configuration`` blob: there is no source payload to preserve,
    and a person record is exactly where one would collect personal data nobody chose to store.
